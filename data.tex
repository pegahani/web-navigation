We test the experiments on (\PA{three?}) different datasets.  The first dataset is a collected dataset including (\PA{how many persons in experiment?})  researchers and experts from central and sound America. A few information such as year, organisation, graduate degree, original country, domain and destination country of each person who left his/her original country for, is supported in the dataset prepared by the sociologists. 

Another dataset is \PA{Jorge dataset?}

Finally we experiment the navigation web system on \PA{shooting dataset with LSTM instead of NN in DQN}
