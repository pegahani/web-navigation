Using a similar framework as Narasimhan et al. \shortcite{narasimhan2016improving}, we model our web navigator model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) \cite{puterman1994}. . .

This MDP is defined as a tuple $M(S, A, P, r, \gamma)$ where $S$ is a set of states, $A$ is a set of actions, $P :S\times A  \times S  \longrightarrow [0,1]$ is a transition function where $P(s'|s,a)$ encodes the probability of going to state $s'$ by being in state $s$, and choosing action $a$; $r : S \times A \longrightarrow R$ is a reward function (or penalty, if negative) obtained by choosing action $a$ in state $s$.
