\begin{abstract}
We present a modification of \textit{Unoporuno} system first introduced by Flores et al. \citep{Flores2012} as an application of deep reinforcement learning and natural language processing methods to the immigration sociology. A manually extracted database containing researcher and experts of central and south America is supported by the sociologists. By receiving a person name from the sociologists database, We propose a method for extracting her organisation names and related activate years over her professional years using deep reinforcement learning approach. We improve the unoporuno system by tracking each person's professional movements instead of just verifying the hers mobility w.r.t her origin place.

\section{Introduction}
Luis Fernandez left his origin country (Argentina) in  $2005$ for doing a PHD in telecommunication. What does he do now? where is he now? where were other universities or organisations that he has worked for so far? for which periods? Sociologists of imigration and particularly those who are interested in ``brain drain" domain requires great deal of time, manual internet search or data source search (such as CVs, personal Web Pages, etc.) to answer such fine-grained examples \cite{Auriol2010,Meyer2006}. 


\section{Related Work}

In this section we review the literature of the used \textit{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} methods for extracting information and introduce a background on application of \textit{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} and DRL methods on sociology of migration application and Web People Search (WPS) tasks.
