  This paper presents an original approach for extracting experts mobility traces from the web based on deep reinforcement learning. In the broad context of Digital Humanities, the goal of our work is to assist migration sociologists studying expert's international mobility trajectories with natural language processing methods. Deep-Q networks have recently shown promising results improving information extraction methods from web results. Given an expert's name, our method harvests information from web search engines and extracts the optimal expert's mobility trajectory (a set of triplets containing institution, city and year) from it by means of a Deep-Q network and various neural network architectures for the Q-value function approximation. This paper presents experimental evidence improving the current state of the art on expert finding, and extending the existing task with a chronological graph of the experts professional trajectory. 

  %We present at a first time, a people tracking system (specifically the expert people with available and extractable information in the web) as an application of deep reinforcement learning and natural language processing methods to the immigration sociology. The Deep Q-network has been used for extracting information from huge size text datasets and finding the most precise name entities. In this paper, for the sociology term of usage, we propose a method for tracking a give person name and extracting her optimal professional trajectory by exploring the web and generating as less as possible number of queries. Our proposed approach is based on a Deep Q-network method with various neural networks for the Q-value function approximation. We improve the existed people search systems by tracking the experts professional trajectories instead of just labeling them as a mobile or local person w.r.t their origin countries.

\section{Introduction}
Luis Fernandez\footnote{All names have been changed to protect identity.} grew up in Argentina and studied a Biotechnology Masters's degree at the University of Buenos Aires. In $2010$ he got an international scholarship and went to Essex University for a PhD. Where is he now? Did he stay in the UK, or did he come back to Argentina? How did his expert skills evolve? In other words, what are his \textit{professional mobility traces}?

Reaching expatriate members of the \textit{highly qualified diaspora} is a major challenge for policy makers \cite{CIDESAL}. Migrations sociologists studying mobility patterns of this \textit{diaspora of knowledge} use statistical sources, like population censues, labor force surveys and administrative data \cite{Turner}. However, these sources are not entirely satisfactory when monitoring constantly changing mobility trends, so recent scientific efforts have been dedicated to mine the Web in order better understand the dynamics of this expert migration flow \cite{GarciaFlores, Russians, Auriol2010}.

This paper presents ongoing research on extracting experts mobility trajectories from the web by means of a reinforcement learning (RL}) based method. Given an expert's name, our method harvests information from web search engines in order to extract a set of named entity triplets \texttt{<institution, city, year>} considered as meaningful points in the expert's mobility trajectory. Figure~\ref{fig:traj} shows the mobility trajectory of two biotechnology experts. Migration sociologists are particularly interested in the \textit{brain drain/brain gain} phenomenon \cite{Meyer}: while the top example of the figure has not returned to his/hers home country, the bottom individual has.
%In this work, we are interested in extracting a trajectory for each given expert including her organisation names and the related years by searching their given names through the web and extracting as accurate as possible name entities (In the rest of this work, by the name entities we mean the organisation names, university names or dates) from the web.  For instance, a researcher as ``Luis Fernandez" has a mobile professional trajectory with various oraganisations and year of experience as figure~\ref{fig:traj} (top graph) though another person (the bottom graph) has a local professional trajectory and he works in his original country recently.  
  
An intuitive approach for extracting experts mobility trajectories consists on querying web search engines with the expert's name plus different keywords, and then extracting city, institution and year from the resulting snippets list. The main question then would be when to generate a new query and which snippets should be taken into account in order to extract meaningful named entities concerning the expert's professional trajectory. Recent scientific evidence shows promising results of Deep-Q networks based methods on information extraction tasks \citep{narasimhan2016improving}, as well as on object detection in images \cite{Caicedo2015}, arithmetic word problems solving \cite{wang2018} and text generation \citep{Guo2015}. Inspired by Narasimhan et al. \shortcite{narasimhan2016improving} work on information extraction from huge search spaces, we model the expert's mobility traces extraction task as an optimal policy search in RL, where we consider a Deep Q-network and various neural network models to learn Q-value functions and approximate the optimal expert's track for a given expert name.  
%for tracking each given expert's profession usingbased  deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. Deep Q-network (DQN) usage in various problems and the tracking issue as a planning problem motivate us concentrating on this approach.

The main contribution of the present paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item To the best of our knowledge, this is the first expert's mobility tracking approach based on  Deep RL methods. 
\item The Q-value function depends on the sequence of resulting snippets selection through from web search engines. For this reason, we replace the Deep-Q neural network \cite{mnih2015} with a Long Short Term Memory {\smallLSTM} network and \PA{improving previous results by \%  }
\item \PA{We test our methods on .... dataset and improve the results by .... }
\end{itemize}

In this section we review the literature of the \textit{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} methods used for the web based information extraction problems. We also introduce a background on the application of \textit{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} and DRL methods on sociology of migration application and Web People Search (WPS) tasks.
