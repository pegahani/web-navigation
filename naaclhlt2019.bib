abstract="As more and more user traces become available as Linked Data Web, using those traces for expert finding becomes an interesting challenge, especially for the open innovation platforms. The existing expert search approaches are mostly limited to one corpus and one particular type of trace -- sometimes even to a particular domain. We argue that different expert communities use different communication channels as their primary mean for communicating and disseminating knowledge, and thus different types of traces would be relevant for finding experts on different topics. We propose an approach for adapting the expert search process (choosing the right type of trace and the right expertise hypothesis) to the given topic of expertise, by relying on Linked Data metrics. In a gold standard-based experiment, we have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the values of our metrics and the precision and recall of expert search. We also present hy.SemEx, a system that uses our Linked Data metrics to recommend the expert search approach to serve for finding experts in an open innovation scenario at hypios. The evaluation of the users' satisfaction with the system's recommendations is presented as well.",

This study proposed a TopicRank-based document priors model for expert finding. TopicRank algorithm is an extension of the DocRank algorithm. Latent dirichlet allocation was used to extract topics of the documents. We assumed there was a link between two documents that share common topics. Link analysis techniques were then used to obtain document priors. The proposed model was evaluated using the CSIRO Enterprise Research Collection and the results showed that the performance of the expert finding system was dramatically improved by introducing TopicRank-based document priors. In particular, Mean Average Precision increased 19.9{\%} while Mean Reciprocal Rank rose as much as 23.4{\%}.",

abstract = "Social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. has changed the way peoples communicate and make decision. In this regard, various companies are willing to use these media to raise their reputation. In this paper, a reputation management system is proposed which measures the reputation of a given company by using the social media data, particularly tweets of Twitter. Taking into account the name of the company and its' related tweets, it is determined that a given tweet has either negative or positive impact on the company's reputation or product. The proposed method is based on N-gram learning approach, which consists of two steps: train step and test step. In the training step, we consider four profiles i.e. positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant profiles for each company. Then 80% of the available tweets are used to build the companies' profiles. Each profile contains the terms that have been appeared in the tweets of each company together with the terms' frequencies. Then in the test step, which is performed on the 20% remaining tweets of the dataset, each tweet is compared with all of the built profiles, based on distance criterion to examine how the given tweet affects a company's reputation. Evaluation of the proposed method indicates that this method has a better efficiency and performance in terms of recall and precision compared to the previous methods such as Neural Network and Bayesian method."

abstract = "A major problem in monitoring the online reputation of companies, brands, and other entities is that entity names are often ambiguous (apple may refer to the company, the fruit, the singer, etc.). The problem is particularly hard in microblogging services such as Twitter, where texts are very short and there is little context to disambiguate. In this paper we address the filtering task of determining, out of a set of tweets that contain a company name, which ones do refer to the company. Our approach relies on the identification of filter keywords: those whose presence in a tweet reliably confirm (positive keywords) or discard (negative keywords) that the tweet refers to the company. We describe an algorithm to extract filter keywords that does not use any previously annotated data about the target company. The algorithm allows to classify 58% of the tweets with 75% accuracy; and those can be used to feed a machine learning algorithm to obtain a complete classification of all tweets with an overall accuracy of 73%. In comparison, a 10-fold validation of the same machine learning algorithm provides an accuracy of 85%, i.e., our unsupervised algorithm has a 14% loss with respect to its supervised counterpart. Our study also shows that (i) filter keywords for Twitter does not directly derive from the public information about the company in the Web: a manual selection of keywords from relevant web sources only covers 15% of the tweets with 86% accuracy; (ii) filter keywords can indeed be a productive way of classifying tweets: the five best possible keywords cover, in average, 28% of the tweets for a company in our test collection."
